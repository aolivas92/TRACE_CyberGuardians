class NLP:
    """
    Handles text preprocessing and analysis for AI credential generation.

    This class provides methods for processing natural language text data to prepare
    it for AI credential generation systems. It includes functionality for text
    normalization, tokenization, and various text transformations.

    Attributes:
        No public attributes.

    Methods:
        normalize(text_to_normalize: list[str]) -> None:
            Normalizes the input text in place.

        trim_short_words(text: list[str]) -> None:
            Removes words shorter than a minimum threshold from the text list.

        break_compound_words(text: list[str]) -> None:
            Splits compound words connected by apostrophes.

        remove_delimeters(text: list[str]) -> None:
            Removes common articles and delimiter words from the text list.

    Notes:
        This class doesn't inherit from any superclass and doesn't define
        any private responsibilities outside of its methods.

        Normalize the input text, in place.

        This method performs text normalization operations on each string in the provided list,
        modifying the list contents directly without returning a new object. Normalization
        may include operations such as:
        - Converting text to lowercase
        - Removing special characters
        - Standardizing whitespace
        - Removing accents/diacritics
        - Expanding contractions
        - Standardizing text encodings

            ValueError: If normalization fails for any string in the list.
